            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>The objective of the plant growth experiment is to determine how different light conditions affect the growth of plants. This involves:

Investigating Growth Variability: Observing how plants perform under various lighting situations (full sunlight, partial sunlight, and no sunlight).
Understanding Light Requirements: Gaining insights into the importance of light as a critical factor in plant development, which can include aspects such as height, leaf health, and overall vitality.
Learning Scientific Methodology: Engaging in the scientific method by formulating a hypothesis, conducting controlled experiments, collecting and analyzing data, and drawing conclusions based on observations.</p>

            <h2>Materials Needed</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>3 identical pots</li>
                <li>3 small plants (e.g., bean plants)</li>
                <li>Soil</li>
                <li>Ruler</li>
                <li>Water</li>
                <li>Light source (lamp, sunlight, etc.)</li>
                <li>Notebook for observations</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Fill each pot with the same amount of soil.</li>
                <li>Plant one seedling in each pot.</li>
                <li>Label each pot according to the light condition it will receive:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pot 1: Full sunlight</li>
                    <li>Pot 2: Partial sunlight</li>
                    <li>Pot 3: No sunlight (place in a dark area)</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Water each plant equally every 2 days.</li>
                <li>Place the pots in their designated light conditions.</li>
                <li>Measure the height of each plant weekly using a ruler.</li>
                <li>Document your observations and any other notable changes in growth.</li>
                <li>Continue the experiment for at least 4 weeks.</li>
            </div>

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>After 1 week (2 weeks total) observe if “leached” cups now have plants that are growing. Did leaching help the same for saline vs. alkali soils?</p>
			<p>After 2 weeks, measure the height of plants in each cup and record the results. Again, observe the roots and record observations on the data sheet.</p>
